			<span style="font-size:14px";><b>what is cloud computing?</b></span>
			<p>Cloud computing changes the way we think about technology. Cloud is a computing model providing web-based software, middleware and computing resources on demand.</p>
			<p>By deploying technology as a service, you give users access only to the resources they need for a particular task. This prevents you from paying for idle computing resources. Cloud computing can also go beyond cost savings by allowing your users to access the latest software and infrastructure offerings to foster business innovation.</p>
			<p>Maisa<sup style="font-size:7px">TM</sup> Solutions offers Software Development Services taking advantage of Cloud Computing technologies like the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and the Simple Storage Service (S3).
