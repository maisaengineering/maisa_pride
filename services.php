                <p>Like ruby on Rails, agile software development is another one of our key tools. A group of light-weight development methodologies, Agile favors "individuals and interactions over process and tools", avoids heavy documentation, and emphasizes continuous software releases through small iteractions.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Anchoring our process with Agile methodologies allows us to create applications in less time with fewer resources. We are able to discover issues and change direction more quickly when something doesn't work of step on the gas when it does.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Agile is not just a series of processes, through. Where other software development companies see Agile as a check box on their services page, our developers have adopted it as a philosophy. We believe this is the best way to develop software and when you see our results, we think you'll agree.</p></td>
