			<p>Since a business needs presence on iPhones, applications are continuously being created to connect the space between the business and the end-users using iPhone.</p>

				<li>We develop applications that take advantage of the iPhone technology like multi-touch interface, GPS, accelerometer etc</li>
				</ol>
			<p>Having iOS and Mac technologies at the core, the engineering teams for iPhone and iPad application development work to provide uniqueness to each application. They do this by leveraging the different form factors, thereby bringing a special and unmatched end-user experience.</p>
